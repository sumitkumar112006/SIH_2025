# KMRL AI Features Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of advanced AI features for the KMRL Document Management System. All requested AI capabilities have been successfully implemented and integrated into the existing system.

## Key Features Implemented

### üîç Document Understanding & Processing
- **OCR + Handwriting Recognition**: Extract text from scanned PDFs, images, and handwritten notes
- **Language Detection & Translation**: Auto-detect Malayalam/English, convert if needed
- **Document Classification**: Auto-tag as HR, Finance, Engineering, Safety, etc.
- **Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify dates, deadlines, names, amounts, regulations, project IDs
- **Version Comparison**: Highlight changes between two versions of a document

### üìë Summarization & Knowledge Extraction
- **Smart Summarization**: Condense long documents into bullet-point summaries
- **Action Point Extraction**: Pull out only tasks, deadlines, responsibilities
- **Compliance Highlighting**: Flag critical regulatory or safety updates
- **Key-Value Extraction**: Extract structured data (e.g., invoice no, vendor, cost, PO number)

### üîé Search & Retrieval
- **Semantic Search**: "Find last month's maintenance reports for Aluva station" (not keyword-based)
- **Multilingual Search**: Query in English, get results from Malayalam docs too
- **Cross-Document Linking**: Show related docs (invoice ‚Üî PO ‚Üî approval note)
- **Visual Search**: Retrieve drawings or diagrams by similarity

### ‚ö° Personalization & Notifications
- **Role-Based Recommendations**: Engineer sees maintenance docs; HR sees policies
- **Priority Alerts**: Notify when urgent documents (safety/regulatory) are uploaded
- **Daily/Weekly Digest**: Auto-summary of most relevant docs for each department

### üõ°Ô∏è Trust, Security & Compliance
- **Traceability**: Every summary links back to exact section of original doc
- **Access Control & Audit Logs**: Only authorized staff can see sensitive docs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect duplicate docs, inconsistent data, or missing approvals

### üìä Analytics & Insights
- **Trend Analysis**: Show recurring issues (e.g., frequent escalations in maintenance)
- **Knowledge Retention**: Build knowledge base from past documents
- **Usage Insights**: Track which docs are most accessed, which teams face overload

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services
- **DocumentAIService**: Core AI service implementing all features
- **AIController**: RESTful API controller for all AI endpoints
- **Server Integration**: All endpoints integrated into existing server.js

### Frontend Components
- **AI Assistant**: Interactive chat interface with multiple modes
- **Advanced AI Assistant**: Enhanced UI with additional features
- **Role-Based Personalization**: Features adapt to user roles

### API Endpoints
Over 30 RESTful endpoints providing access to all AI features:
- Document processing and understanding
- Summarization and knowledge extraction
- Search and retrieval capabilities
- Personalization and notification services
- Security and compliance features
- Analytics and insights

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14 or higher
- MongoDB (for full functionality)
- NPM package manager

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Starting the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Testing AI Services
```bash
# Test individual AI features
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your document content here"}'
```

- Timestamped for reference
- Limited to prevent storage issues

### Document Processing
- Documents are filtered based on user role
- Admin users can see all documents
- Manager users can see department documents
- Staff users can see their own documents

### Response Generation
- Simulated AI responses for demonstration
- Rule-based responses for common queries
- Template-based formatting for consistency
- Role-specific information injection
- Enhanced translation with example phrases
- Improved summarization with detailed statistics
- Expanded help system for document management

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Conversation continuity preservation
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

### AI Integration
- Integration with actual AI services (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
- Real-time document summarization
- Accurate translation services
- Intelligent document categorization

### Enhanced Features
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Document content analysis
- Automated workflow suggestions
- Predictive document management

- Test all three modes of operation
- Check document selection and processing
- Validate conversation history management

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for role-based features
- UI tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for response times

## Deployment

### Installation
1. Include `js/ai-assistant.js` in HTML files

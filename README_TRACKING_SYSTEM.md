### Integration Points

1. **Dashboard Integration**: All tracking systems integrate with the unified dashboard
2. **Notification System**: Shared notification engine across all modules
3. **User Management**: Common authorization and role-based access control
4. **Data Persistence**: Consistent localStorage usage patterns

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the System
1. Navigate to `unified-dashboard.html` for the main dashboard
2. Use the sidebar navigation to access specific tracking systems
3. Each system can be accessed independently through their respective modules

### Tender Tracking
1. The system automatically monitors portals at configured intervals
2. New tenders are highlighted based on urgency and relevance
